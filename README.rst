Programmer Skill Tree
=====================

Programmer Skill Tree is, like `skill tree`_ in our favorite RPG game, `graphs`_ of skills that relate to programming.

This checklist aim for CS students who want to track their progess,
and programmers who want to recall what they forget and collect what they miss.

Inspire by `this post on Quora`_ and, of course, `Diablo II`_.
