Programmer Skill Tree
=====================

Programmer Skill Tree is, like `skill tree`_ in our favorite RPG game, `graphs`_ of skills that relate to programming.

This checklist aim for CS students who want to track their progess,
and programmers who want to recall what they forget and collect what they miss.

Inspire by `this post on Quora`_ and, of course, `Diablo II`_.


Skill Mapping Concept
=====================

=============== ===================
      RPG           Programming
=============== ===================
Weapons / Armor            Language
Stat & Skill       Programmer Skill
Quest           Framework / Project
=============== ===================

- Language is, like a weapon, something that user use to accomplish task.
  They may use 2 or more languages at a time (like holding weapons each hand).
- Programmer Skill is technique that user learn and can be use forever.
  It must independent from the languages (weapons), says, a hunter can shoot
  an arrow with the same critical rate despite bows he/she using.
  It may, however, depend on some type of weapons using at that time, like a
  hunter cannot use throwing knife skill while he/she currently use a bow.
- Framework is like a quest, many language and skills are need.
  Some framework might require others, or recursively require itself.
